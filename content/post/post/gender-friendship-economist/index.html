  <p>
    An article published by <strong>The Economist</strong> examines whether men and women can
    maintain platonic friendships and why these relationships matter for gender equality.
    Using large-scale social data, the article suggests that societies with more everyday
    interaction between men and women tend to exhibit lower levels of gender bias.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nuray Karaman, a sociologist at Uşak University, notes that in Turkey, friendships between
    men and women are relatively uncommon because women’s behavior is closely tied to family honor.
    This norm reinforces gender segregation and limits equal social and professional interaction.
  </p>

  <p>
    The article argues that cross-gender friendship is not only possible, but also plays a crucial
    role in reducing stereotypes and supporting more equal societies.
