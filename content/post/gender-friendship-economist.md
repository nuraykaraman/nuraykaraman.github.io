An article published by **The Economist** examines whether men and women can maintain
platonic friendships and why these relationships matter for gender equality. Using
large-scale social data, the article shows that societies with more everyday interaction
between men and women tend to exhibit lower levels of gender bias.

Nuray Karaman, a sociologist at Uşak University, explains that in Turkey, friendships
between men and women are relatively uncommon because women’s behavior is closely tied
to family honor. This norm reinforces gender segregation and limits equal social and
professional interaction.

The article argues that cross-gender friendship is not only possible, but also plays a
crucial role in reducing stereotypes and supporting more equal societies.
