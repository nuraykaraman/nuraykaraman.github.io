# About Me

I am an Assistant Professor of Psychology at Texas A&M University–Kingsville.
My research focuses on language learning and cognition across development, with a particular emphasis on how learners extract patterns and structure from linguistic input. I use behavioral and experimental methods to study language processing in children and adults.
I am especially interested in statistical learning, language development, and the relationship between language and broader cognitive processes. My work aims to better understand the mechanisms that support language acquisition and learning across the lifespan.
